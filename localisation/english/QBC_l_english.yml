 quebec.1.t:0 "The Resignation of [ROOT.GetLeader]"
 quebec.1.d:0 "It appears that [ROOT.GetLeader] has resigned after a recent scandal portraying him as a fraudulent man. Details are still unclear and the media is jumping on this occasion but [ROOT.GetLeader] has already appointed his successor."
 quebec.1.a:0 "This sure will hurt the reputation of the ruling party"
 quebec.2.t:0 "Quebec asks for an alliance!"
 quebec.2.d:0 "Ever since the new regime up north in the ex-province of quebec looked up at a new form of governance, we have been noticing certain changes to their own culture to give us a place in their fleur-de-lis shaped heart! However, their ambition grows beyond their current land and they asks us for an alliance in case things would go south"
 quebec.2.a:0 "We proudly declare a new age for both our nations!"
 quebec.2.b:0 "We are not interested in their antics."
 quebec.3.t:0 "Amazing news!"
 quebec.3.d:0 "Our French friends have accepted our fair offer! From now on, we are officially allied with their government!"
 quebec.3.a:0 "Together we shall ride to victory, Hurrah!"
 quebec.4.t:0 "Deception from our friends"
 quebec.4.d:0 "Our diplomats came back from the French capital with tragic news! The current government in charge will not be joining our glorious alliance."
 quebec.4.a:0 "Maybe the Germans were right.. They ARE cowards!"
 quebec.5.t:0 "The Border Question"
 quebec.5.d:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] recently called his cabinet in for an emergency meeting about an important question. Turns out closing the borders out of a post-independence panic had immense impacts on our economy! [ROOT.GetLeader] proposed to his small audience if it would be wise to ask the [CAN.GetName]'s government opinion on a mutual solution to this issue.\n\nSome people, mostly anti-immigrant ministers and [ROOT.GetAdjective] nationalists harshly oppose this idea, thinking that this might lead to a total control by the [CAN.GetName] administration over our politics and economy. Sadly, they don't realise that this scenario might be a necessity in the future."
 quebec.5.a:0 "We have to ask our Canadian friends!"
 quebec.6.t:0 "An Interesting Offer"
 quebec.6.d:0 "Today, [ROOT.GetLeader] was surprised by an unusual letter coming from the [QBC.GetName]. This letter describes a plan for a possible future cooperation. With all the investments we have in their country, they say, we should feel inclined to consider their proposal. However, some angry ministers reject these demands, saying that [QBC.GetName] is already gone and should pay the price."
 quebec.6.a:0 "I don't see anything wrong with helping an old friend."
 quebec.6.b:0 "They should've kept the borders open, fools!"
 quebec.7.t:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] Accepts"
 quebec.7.d:0 "In a recent meeting with his cabinet [CAN.GetLeader] has reported back some amazing news : The borders between [ROOT.GetNameDef] and [CAN.GetNameDef] will no longer have any restrictions, allowing free passage between our people! This is a great day in the history of both our nations!"
 quebec.7.a:0 "Amazing!"
 quebec.8.t:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] Refuses"
 quebec.8.d:0 "In a recent address [CAN.GetNameDef] confirmed our worst fears. Our diplomatic ties has collapsed, and even worse, their government has openly criticized us, calling us "fools" and blaming us for the troubles of [CAN.GetNameDef]! Any relation between our countries has exploded.."
 quebec.8.a:0 "This is the death of our friendly relations.."
 quebec.9.t:0 "The Final Demand"
 quebec.9.d:0 "After a change of direction, Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader] of [ROOT.GetNameDef] and Prime Minister [CAN.GetLeader] of [CAN.GetNameDef] met in Ottawa today for the last favor that [ROOT.GetLeader] had to ask. [ROOT.GetSheHe] asked the honorable [CAN.GetLeader] if [CAN.GetSheHe] would agree on a special proposal. [ROOT.GetNameDef] would join [CAN.GetNameDef] once again but as an autonomous nation within Canada. \n\nThis would give the Federal government control over some sectors of our country while giving us plenty of autonomy. Nationalists and various sceptics already oppose this deal, having no idea of the benefits of the possible agreement while a part of the population rejoice at the idea of joining Canada once more..."
 quebec.9.a:0 "Let's hope they make the right choice!"
 quebec.10.t:0 "Assistance at a Price"
 quebec.10.d:0 "It has been a very stressful week for the leading government, but [ROOT.GetLeader] finally had some good news to occupy his thoughts beyond the countless fears about the state of the Québécois nation. Canada accepted our offer to join the confederation as a distinct nation. Nationalists are up at arms, screaming about 'subjugation' and 'treason', but [CAN.GetLeader] assured the population by telling us it was simply the right thing to do."
 quebec.10.a:0 "Well, atleast we are safe."
 quebec.11.t:0 "An Offer from Québec"
 quebec.11.d:0 "Today representatives from the nation of Québec approached us with a tempting offer. They claim that for their fight against Canadian imperialist they need our help and would like to join the Comintern"
 quebec.11.a:0 "We accept their offer!"
 quebec.11.b:0 "Why should we waste ressources on Québec?"
 quebec.12.t:0 "Sigh of Relief"
 quebec.12.d:0 "Everyone across the province in celebrating the recent news! According to Chairman Rose, the Soviet Union and our glorious socialist republic has entered in an official alliance!"
 quebec.12.a:0 "May this newfound alliance prove itself fruitful!"
 quebec.13.t:0 "Disaster!"
 quebec.13.d:0 "Tonight, the ruling cabinet had an emergency meeting about one crucial issue. The letter sent to the Soviet came back negative, they seemingly refused our offer for protection!"
 quebec.13.a:0 "Guess we'll have to do without them."
 quebec.14.t:0 "oops! that's a bug! (sorry)"
 quebec.14.d:0 "i have genuinely no idea how this event triggers and my code is unclear, if you see this, this is a bug :)"
 quebec.14.a:0 "to bugreport I go!"
 quebec.15.t:0 "Peculiar Request"
 quebec.15.d:0 "Once again, [QBC.GetNameDef] has sent yet another request. This time, however, this request has left Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader] shocked. According to the letter, [QBC.GetLeader] was asking for their own entry in the confederation to be restored with one condition. They are asking for extended autonomy, basically just becoming our vassals and not proper Canadian territory. Most of our population would accept the Québécois with open arms but one question has to be asked; Should we allow them another chance?"
 quebec.15.a:0 "May our Québécois friends feel welcomed back among us!"
 quebec.15.b:0 "Tell them we've got enough of their silly requests!"
 quebec.16.t:0 "From one Prime Minister to Another."
 quebec.16.d:0 "After our independence, we have realised that cutting off all ties with our biggest and most important neighbor would be foolish, thus, many in parliament suggested reopening diplomatic ties with [CAN.GetNameDef] and most agreed. some fearing domination by [USA.GetNameDef] and others by what they call 'Common sense'."
 quebec.16.a:0 "May [CAN.GetNameDef] do the right thing."
 quebec.17.t:0 "[QBC.GetNameDef] wants to re-establish diplomatic relations."
 quebec.17.d:0 "Today [QBC.GetNameDef] has sent a message with a different tone. For perhaps the ofirst time since their independence they would like to re-establish permanent diplomatic contants with us! Many has already criticized this as the obvious counterblow of their independence and our chance to leave them alone as a 'consequence of their actions' yet many others think that re-establishing links would be the first step toward Quebeco-Canadian friendship."
 quebec.17.a:0 "There can be only good things to come out from diplomacy!"
 quebec.17.b:0 "No, I don't think we will."
 quebec.18.t:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] has accepted Re-establishing Relations!"
 quebec.18.d:0 "Fortunately, [CAN.GetNameDef] has accepted our proposal and ambassadors shall arrive shortly!"
 quebec.18.a:0 "Hurrah for Franco-Canadians relations!"
 quebec.19.t:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] have Refused any Communications!"
 quebec.19.d:0 "Unfortunately, [CAN.GetNameDef], in their ego-filled rage, has refused our friendly proposal! Furthermore, they told us to deal with our problems alone or to join the Confederation again!"
 quebec.19.a:0 "May they be damned! We don't need them!"
 quebec.20.t:0 "Québec cuts all Ties!"
 quebec.20.d:0 "In a surprising move, Prime Minister [QBC.GetLeader] of [QBC.GetNameDef] has declared, to both its national population and the international community, that [QBC.GetNameDef] will immediately cut any diplomatic ties that [QBC.GetNameDef] held with us!"
 quebec.20.a:0 "May they be damned! We don't need them!"
 quebec.21.t:0 "Vive le Québec Libre!"
 quebec.21.d:0 "Despite everything standing against our way, our nation has finally formed itself and so far has triumphed over any obstacles! Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader] has commented on the historic success of [ROOT.GetNameDef]!"
 quebec.21.a:0 "A new dawn for the Québecois nation!"
 quebec.22.t:0 "Miraculous Recovery"
 quebec.22.d:0 "Everywhere in Québec, life seems to take a gradual return to a new level of normality. Homelessness is at its lowest, widespread poverty is merely a thing of the past and the people are spending left and right. It doesn't take an expert economist to notice that the québecois economy is booming. Corporations are getting richer and richer and can afford to invest in our territory!"
 quebec.22.a:0 "We lived through the worst, we can do anything!"
 quebec.23.t:0 "The General Strike!"
 quebec.23.d:0 "Today, workers and students alike, no matter their background, took to the streets with one goal : break their supposed chains. By the end of the day, the government led by [QBC.GetLeader] has seized their control over the country and have given all powers to the leaders of the general strike. The Parti Ouvrier Progressiste is now in power and its leader will lead Québec in a new age."
 quebec.23.a:0 "Arise ye workers from your slumbers..!"
 quebec.24.t:0 "The First Nationalist Congress of Québec"
 quebec.24.d:0 "After hours of debate and discussion amongst the different wings of the [QBC.GetRulingPartyLong] the organisers decided that it was now time to vote. The enthusiastic crowd now started to vote for their preffered candidate between the two available.."
 quebec.24.a:0 "..We want Paul Bouchard!"
 quebec.24.b:0 "..Vive le Québec Catholique! Lionel Groulx will bring us to glory!"
 quebec.25.t:0 "Deal with the Opposition"
 quebec.25.d:0 "Everything is in place, the police is awaiting orders and the militias are ready to raid the hideout of our notable opponents! We just need the 'Go-ahead'! Who shall we target?"
 quebec.25.a:0 "We can trust no-one! Purge everybody! Focus on everyone!"
 quebec.25.b:0 "We will collaborate with other authoritarian groups, focus of the pro-democratic resistance!"
 quebec.25.c:0 "We will invite pro-democratic elements that are willing to support our cause, focus on the communists!"
