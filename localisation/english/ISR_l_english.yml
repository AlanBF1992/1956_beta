 israel.1.t:0 "Irgun Coup!"
 israel.1.d:0 "Forced to cooperate together during the recent war, The Haganah and Irgun reluctantly fought side by side to secure the country's independence. Now however, with our independence secure for the time being, the disorganized army has fragmented once more. With tensions at an all time high, a conflict between Haganah and Irgun soldiers in Tel Aviv escalated into a country-wide coup, with the Irgun succesfully taking over control."
 israel.1.a:0 "Ze'ev Jabotinsky will lead us to glory!"

 israel.2.t:0 "Ze'ev Jabotinsky Passes Away"
 israel.2.d:0 "Earlier today, Ze'ev Jabotinsky suffered a fatal heart attack. Mourners over the nation gathered at his funeral at Herzl Mountain Cemetary, even with some Mapai members showing up aswell. His successor, Menachem Begin, pledges to continue his legacy as leader of Hatsohar."
 israel.2.a:0 "End of an era."

 israel.3.t:0 "The Capital Question"
 israel.3.d:0 "After relocating the capital during the War of Independence, it is time to settle once and for all what the capital of the new Jewish state should be. Many secular groups believe it should stay as the secular hub of Tel Aviv, while more religious communites believe it should be returned to the Holy City of Jerusalem. What shall we chose?"
 israel.3.a:0 "The capital shall stay in Tel Aviv."
 israel.3.b:0 "The capital will be moved back to Jerusalem."

 israel.4.t:0 "The Sixth Aliyah"

This has created an immigration crisis of massive proportions, however we cannot afford to turn anyone down, as our nation would benefit immensily from a population influx."
 israel.4.a:0 "This is a land for all."

 israel.5.t:0 "The Provisional Elections"
 israel.5.d:0 "After convening the Knesset, it is time for our first elections. On the left, Ya'akov Hazan's Democratic Socialist Hashomer Hatsiar party, advocating for closer cooperation with the Soviet Union. On the centre, David Ben-Gurion's Social-Democratic Mapai advocates for an alliance with the west and a pragmatic foreign policy, and on the right there is Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Hatzohar, callling for the formation of an independent Greater Israel on both banks of the Jordan. The country awaits with bated breath to see who will lead it through it's most crucial years."

 israel.5.b:0 "David Ben-Gurion will lead us to a stable country!"
