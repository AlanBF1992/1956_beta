#SWE_destroyer_effort:0"Jagare"
SWE_destroyer_effort_desc:0"Our Destroyers are among the best in the world- even John Bull feels a touch of envy for them. Technology marches on, however, and we have to stay on top of research if we are to stay atop the mountain."
#SWE_sea_wolves:0"Wolfpack"

sweden.1.t:0"Sweden Demands Åland"
sweden.1.d:0"Yesterday, the Swedish Government, having already restored their claim on Åland, made the next logical move- they demanded it outright. Representatives from Stockholm have a point when they say the islands are Swedish majority anyway, but our presence in the Baltic Sea would be vastly diminished. Still, the implication is that the alternative is war- and can we survive invasion?"
sweden.1.a:0"Accept the Demands."
sweden.1.b:0"Åland is rightfully ours!"

sweden.2.t:0"Finland Accepts Demands!"
sweden.2.d:0"Today, for the first time since 1809, the Swedish flag has replaced the Finnish banners flying in Åland. While the populace was mostly apathetic, the Swedish government itself, having scored a diplomatic victory and the most important Naval base in the Gulf of Bothnia, was overjoyed. Conversely, the mood in Finland was somber, and it's particularly notable that despite giving the islands up, Finland still retains a claim on them."
sweden.2.a:0"Finally!"

sweden.3.t:0"The Finns Refuse!"
sweden.3.d:0"The Finns have made the questionable decision that a small island chain is worth risking the lives of their people. Perhaps they have a desire to once again be part of our nation- whatever their train of thought may be, war seems inevitable."
sweden.3.a:0"Outrageous!"

sweden.6.t:0"Invitation to Swedish Faction"
sweden.6.d:0"Sweden has been publicly supporting the idea of a Scandinavian alliance on the diplomatic scene in the last few weeks, and their ambassador to our nation has just informed us that they are intending to turn the concept into a reality.

sweden.14.a:0"Unfortunate"

sweden.19.t:0"Parliamentary Altercations"
sweden.19.d:0"The Åland issue has had farther reaching consequences than we've imagined.

norway.21.t:0"Unions push for Collective representation"
norway.21.d:0"The Socialist elements in our country have been receiving support from international Communist organizations, and are beginning to make demands of the government. The Unions, who are supporting Communism more by the day, are backing them, meaning that if we don't go along, we may see more of those horrible strikes we've been enduring for so long. The demands are simple- either make parliamentary concessions or appoint Henry Wilhelm Kristiansen, one of their top men, to our cabinet. Is it worth the risk?"

norway.20.t:0"Fate of Norway"
norway.20.d:0"The Swedish Foreign Minister recently made a public announcement- the Norwegian Government is not fulfilling its natural duty to protect its interests and keep order within its borders. They say that the only way to prevent foreign invasion is to take control of the military- and government- themselves. They have issued an identical ultimatum to us and have given us 24 hours to reply. Can we fight them off, or must we give up our independence again?"

sweden.51.a:0"Impressive!"


sweden.55.t:0"Sweden asks to join the Allies"
sweden.55.d:0"The Swedes have come to us requesting to join the Allies, seeing the fight for freedom worldwide as more important than avoiding their own conflict. Their navy could be useful and they make impressive weapons, but their military IS rather small. Accepting would be a commitment to securing Scandinavia, lest they simply join us and fall under occupation."
sweden.55.a:0"They are welcome!"
sweden.55.b:0"They're probably spies for Jerry!"

sweden.56.t:0"Brtiain refuses"
sweden.56.d:0"The British have decided they can win the war without us. Overconfident as usual. There was no reason explicitly stated, so we can only guess at the reason for our exclusion. \n\n But they're probably just jealous of our super neat Destroyers."

He's been concerned lately about the NSAP's authoritarian views, and while opposed to Communism, doesn't see it as a particularly potent threat as the NSAP does. If the King could be convinced of the threat the Bolsheviks pose, it would be quite the boon for the NSAP's popularity among the people..."

sweden.70.b:0"His opinion doesn't matter."

sweden.72.t:0"Royalist Newspapers"

sweden.75.t:0"Unite with Finland-Swedes"
sweden.75.d:0"Some of our newly acquired lands in Finland are majority Swedish, and would comfortably be ruled under Sweden proper rather than as a part of Finland. Of course, setting this up would mean a weaker Finnish puppet state if we choose to create one..."
sweden.75.a:0"Swedes under Sweden."
sweden.75.b:0"This is not worth the risk."

sweden.90.t:0"The Regal Cabinet"
sweden.90.d:0"The King has defied Per Albin Hansson's long-standing policy of avoiding any foreign alliance by establishing a pact with Finland, which has opened up a divide between the two former amicable rulers. The King is within full legal right to dismiss and replace him, though this would surely displease the Republican elements of our population. Should Gustaf V carry this plan out?"

sweden.106.t:0"Operation Stella Polaris"
sweden.106.d:0"An unidentified man in a black trenchcoat met up with our head of government today at the Finnish ministry after dark, and explained in a deep, artificial sounding voice that Finland's war with the Soviets going so badly is putting sensitive information at risk. His proposal is to harbor the information here in Sweden instead- with the payment being the right to see some of the information ourselves, on top of the increased relations. The Russians would never approve of such a thing, however."

iceland.11.d:0"It seems like our planned uprising in Iceland didn't quite go as we expected. It seems that the government has been able to silence it with their limited resources. The question is: What do we do now? We could launch a full military invasion ourselves but then we'd also have to deal with Denmark and most likely Greenland."
iceland.11.a:0"Invasion it is!"
iceland.11.b:0"We'll back off for now."

iceland.2.t:0"Icelandic Declares Independence!"
iceland.2.d:0"In a shocking turn of events, the small Danish military presence on Iceland has been kicked off by a small, but well armed group of Nationalists. Danish rule is being threatened- we must restore order! Unless we can't spare the manpower, or perhaps if we had some moral objections..."
iceland.2.a:0"Give them Sovereignty"
iceland.2.b:0"Declare War and take back Iceland!"

iceland.3.t:0"Denmark Declares War on us"
iceland.3.d:0"The Danish government has declared our independence attempt unlawful and is sending an invasion to our shores to try and stop the fun. Sweden has promised us support, but it would be far more impressive, yet difficult, to win on our own..."
iceland.3.a:0"Fight on our Own!"
iceland.3.b:0"Ask the Swedes for help"

iceland.4.t:0"Iceland asks for help"
iceland.4.d:0"Just as we predicted, Iceland has asked us for support against the Danes- a perfect opportunity to strike Denmark down, frankly! We could also leave them to waste their time invading Iceland, but it would be unlikely we'd get another opportunity like this any time soon..."
iceland.4.a:0"They are on their own"
iceland.4.b:0"Fight for Iceland!"

iceland.5.t:0"The Swedes Intervene"
iceland.5.d:0"The Swedes have decided to fight along side us and hope to defeat the Danes on our behalf. Our efforts have not been in vain, it was well worth it."
iceland.5.a:0"Glory and sovereignty is near!"

iceland.7.t:0"Denmark backs down"
iceland.7.d:0"Denmark has accepted Iceland's independence, claiming simply that if it's what the Icelandic people desire, the Danes will not stop them. Almost everyone in Europe is speculating the true reason, but whatever it may be, Iceland is independent without even so much as a casualty."
iceland.7.a:0"Unexpected"

iceland.10.t:0"Arm the Fjölnismenn"
iceland.10.d:0"We have successfully transported arms and officers to the Icelandic Nationalists. The Fjölnismenn as they call themselves, have been keen to receive our support and are now preparing to conduct a rebellion. Are we willing to see it through?"
iceland.10.a:0"Oh, we will!"


r56.news_event.900.t:0"Sweden Puppets Norway"
r56.news_event.900.d:0"Citing a change in the political climate of Europe since their 1905 split, Sweden has rendered Norway nothing more than a puppet state, nominally due to the Norwegian military's inability to control the Scandinavian coastline. Many Norwegians, particularly those old enough to remember the union with Sweden, are protesting the decision, but so far no organized resistance has been mounted. Norway is, once again, Swedish territory."
r56.news_event.900.a:0"Troublesome"

r56.news_event.902.t:0"The Baltic States Rise Up!"
r56.news_event.902.d:0"It seems the Soviet control of the Baltic states is not as solid as it would look from the outside. At midnight last night, pro-independence groups through all of the Baltic states launched a full-scale rebellion against their Soviet overlords. While Lithuania's uprising was controlled by local occupation forces, Estonia and Latvia are still under rebel control as of press time. \n\n While foreign intervention is suspected, no decisive evidence has implicated any nation yet."
r56.news_event.902.a:0"Inspiring!"

r56.news_event.903.t:0"The Baltic States Rise Up!"
r56.news_event.903.d:0"It seems the Soviet control of the Baltic states is not as solid as it would look from the outside. At midnight last night, pro-independence groups through all of the Baltic states launched a full-scale rebellion against their Soviet overlords. While Latvia and Lithuania's uprisings were controlled by local occupation forces, Estonia is still under rebel control as of press time. \n\n During the pacification of Latvia, two men identified as Swedish nationals were arrested. The Soviets have yet to make an official response."
r56.news_event.903.a:0"Sweden is playing with fire."

r56.news_event.904.t:0"Second Finnish Civil-War"
r56.news_event.904.d:0"In rather predictable fashion, Civil War has embroiled once again between Communists and a coalition of Democrats, Fascists, and Monarchists in Finland. Despite broad civil support of the Coalition forces, the Soviet Union has already begun to blatantly sponsor the Communist state, and without foreign intervention, one must wonder how successful they will be in preventing what is in all practicality a coup."
r56.news_event.904.a:0"What, again?"

r56.news_event.905.t:0"Sweden Joins Second Finnish Civil-War"
r56.news_event.905.d:0"In positive news for non-Communists, the Swedish military has declared full support of the Finnish Coalition forces within their Civil War. While Sweden is certainly no match for the Soviet Union, their support may go a long way to balancing the otherwise one-sided conflict, and the potential of more countries backing the Coalition has just increased that much more. \n\n Though Sweden declined it was receiving compensation for its efforts, a commercial vessel in the Baltic sea noted that Swedish infantry brigades were garrison on several islands of the Åland chain."
r56.news_event.905.a:0"Curious turn of Events"

r56.news_event.906.t:0"Sweden revokes the Åland Convention!"
r56.news_event.906.d:0"The Åland Convention was signed in 1921, stating that the namesake islands were legally to be administrated by Finland, but as compensation, the area would not only be granted autonomy, it would also be entirely demilitarized. Seeing this as no longer in Sweden's favor, the largest Nordic nation has once again laid claim to the Islands. In response, Finland has remilitarized the archipelago, and diplomatic relations are starting to sharply decline between the two countries."
r56.news_event.906.a:0"All this over a few islands."
r56.news_event.906.b:0"Finally!"

r56.news_event.907.t:0"The King takes on Communists"
r56.news_event.907.d:0"King Gustaf is a vocal critic of Communism, and recently he's made a major speech denouncing the entire ideology and attempting to convince its supporters to instead support the more moderate Social Democrat party. Due to the King's personal sway with several Swedish civilians, many are abandoning the Hammer and Sickle in favor of a simple leftist Democratic party."
r56.news_event.907.a:0"We must crush the Elites!"

r56.news_event.908.t:0"The King is Arrested!"
r56.news_event.908.d:0"The King Gustaf V has been captured and placed under house arrest in a shocking and bold move by the Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti. The King was on his way to Uppsala, when his motorcade was unexpectedly jumped by armed Partisans. The King's life has been spared in exchange for a guarantee that the monarchy would be abolished and his family would renounce all claims to any throne- but many Swedish citizens are wondering if the Communists will be true to their word."
r56.news_event.908.a:0"Justice for all"

r56.news_event.909.t:0"The King is Exiled!"
r56.news_event.909.d:0"Revolutionaries from the SKP made a violent attack on the palace in Stockholm today in an attempt to capture, or perhaps kill, the Swedish king. The crowd was dismayed to find an empty palace- the King had already escaped under the cover of night, after hearing reports from his bodyguards of members of his kitchen staff openly supporting the move. Sightings of the King and his family are cropping up in several cities around Europe, and no matter where he makes his residence, one can expect him to continue his crusade against Communism."
r56.news_event.909.a:0"The old man's harmless."

r56.news_event.910.t:0"The Buckingham Gathering"
r56.news_event.910.d:0"Gustaf V, the former Swedish king, has made his first major public appearance since his self-imposed exile. After a meeting with the British royal family, the King gave a conference with various global journalist in front of the Palace, describing his situation and making more public jabs against Communism. The global community has generally taken his side, and the only response the sitting Swedish government could muster was calling him a bourgeois reactionary, which has impressed few- if any- foreign dignitaries."
r56.news_event.910.a:0"The nerve!"
r56.news_event.910.b:0"Interesting"

r56.news_event.911.t:0"Sweden and Norway join in a Socialist Union"
r56.news_event.911.d:0"Sweden and Norway are unified once again under what politicians from the new nation have coined the ''Scandinavian Socialist Union''. Though the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and Uruguay are the only nations to officially recognize the new Union, it is impossible to deny that this is a major shift in the balance of power in Scandinavia. If Democratic or Fascist forces want to make a foothold in the region, they now must face a quite powerful bulwark."
r56.news_event.911.a:0"Unexpected"
r56.news_event.911.b:0"A great day!"

r56.news_event.912.t:0"Icelandic Independence"
r56.news_event.912.d:0"Though Iceland's population is small, and its thirst for independence is not significant, a small band of rebels, thought to be armed by an outside power, have risen up today and taken control of the entire island. There is no direct proof, at least any revealed so far, but international observers are speculating that the benefactors were either from the German or Swedish government. Denmark has yet to make a response, though an attempt to re-occupy the island is expected."
r56.news_event.912.a:0"How will the Danes respond?"

sweden_soviet.112.t:0 "Finland stand defiant"
sweden_soviet.112.d:0 "It turns out that the Finns aren't as much of a push over as we may have anticipated, but nevertheless now they face Soviet wrath. It'll be a wonder if Finland survive for more than a month."
