 mandate_palestine.203.d:0 "\nShocking news out of Jerusalem today, [MPL.GetLeader] has announced that the Mandate of Palestine would be coming to an end. He claims that the ongoing Arab revolt has shown the leadership that the mandate is not sustainable and that a settlement must come soon. The local authorities will move towards preparing the region for an independent union state.\n\nMany people believe that there is no chance a union state could exist in the Levant, but others are hopeful for a peaceful outcome. Nevertheless, the Mandate authorities plan to move forward."

 mandate_palestine.204.d:0 "\nWith the Arab revolts in full swing in the Mandate, [MPL.GetLeader] has issued emergency regulations.

 mandate_palestine.1001.t:0 "Just Another Day " 
 mandate_palestine.1001.d:0 "It was not the first time Yair would walk through the Haifa markets. Ever since he made Aliyah, he was doing the best he could to get by. Although it was much less comfortable than his life back in Poland, atleast he had a strong community to protect him. Besides, it was for a noble cause, wasn’t it?\n\n“Stop!” Yair looked to his side to see a fight erupting between a Jew and a couple Arabs. He couldn’t determine the cause, but this sight was nothing out of the ordinary for him, so he did not pay much attention to it. Before his Aliyah, he always believed the Jews and Arabs could get along. While it was working out in some areas, his life in Haifa would lower his faith every day.\n\n“One day..”, he thought to himself." 
 mandate_palestine.1001.a:0 "One day."
 
 mandate_palestine.1002.t:0 "A Bit of Hope" 
 mandate_palestine.1002.d:0 "Walking through the Haifa market yet again, Yair couldn't help but notice the overall change of mood around the city since the recent announcement. Sure, the violence didn't stop, but the overall feeling had changed. It felt as if the people had gained a bit of hope, Jews and Arabs alike. No one expected the British to stand down, it came as a shock to all equally. But even so, Yair felt a sense of cooperation amongst the people, something he had not felt since his arrival.\n\nPerhaps a change was coming?"
 mandate_palestine.1002.a:0 "One step forward."
 
 mandate_palestine.1003.t:0 "A Dream Realized"
 mandate_palestine.1003.d:0 "The market felt different this time. For the first time, Yair saw Arabs and Jews working together effectively. He saw parents with their children, who were usually too afraid to bring them to places like these. He saw elderly people being assisted in carrying their purchases. Such a difference, he thought to himself.\n\nSuddenly, Yair was startled by a crashing sound behind him. He almost instinctively tried to brace himself, thinking it was yet another fight, but he turned around to see that one of the seller's shelves had collapsed, and people were rushing to help pick up the fruits that had fallen on the ground.\n\nYair smiled."
 mandate_palestine.1003.a:0 "Per Aspera Ad Astra"
 
 mandate_palestine.1004.t:0 "A Dream Deferred"
 mandate_palestine.1004.d:0 "As the bullet knocked him to the ground, Yair thought of all the choices that had been made to lead to this moment. There had been hope. There had been effort. But it was all for nothing.\n\nAs he bled out, he just wished his young son would have a better life than him. Perhaps there was a purpose for his sacrifice. Perhaps there was no other way.\n\nPerhaps."
 mandate_palestine.1004.a:0 "One death a tragedy, One million a statistic."
