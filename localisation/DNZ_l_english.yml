 danzig.1.t:0 "The Free City of Danzig"
 danzig.1.desc:0 "After the Great War, the Free City of Danzig was established as a way to ensure the use of a port for the newly reborn Polish state. This compromise was necessary instead of a full annexation because the vast majority of the population of Danzig is ethnically German. \n\n The rise of ultra nationalism in Germany has brought in its wake total control of the local instutions to the NSDAP. Currently those Nazi politicians whom only desire is a reunification with Germany are keeping a relatively quiet, but this could change soon and in the case of a crisis, the City-state would most probably disappear and be annexed by Poland or Germany."
