Later, one of the publishing house closed as a result of harassment and French censorship, the VNQDD was officially established by Nguyen Thai Hoc, taking Sun-Yat-Sen's Kuomintang as an inspiration. The party became known for its many assassinations, including that of Alfred François Bazin, a French labour recruiter in Hanoi. In 1930, a large-scale revolt was planned against France, known as the Mutinerie de Yen Bai, but it failed, resulting in the arrest and execution of many of its leaders, including Nguyen Thai Hoc. However, the party continued to survive thanks to the Vietnamese exiled in China, where they received support from the Kuomintang government.§!"

 VIN_cement_rule_in_the_villages_desc:0 "In Vietnam, there is a saying called “Phép Vua Thua Lệ Làng”, literally meaning that the emperor is secondary to village customs and implicitly indicating that national rule at the village was given a way to autonomous rule by village itself. If we wish to maintain the government authority, it is necessary to bring all the villages under the supreme authority of the government."

 VIN_the_permanent_siege:0 "The Permanent Siege"
 VIN_the_permanent_siege_desc:0 "We are isolated from the rest of our communist brothers. Mao is isolated in the mountains while an ocean separates us from the Soviet Union.

 VIN_invite_soviet_industrial_experts_desc:0 "The Soviets were able to transform Russia from a peasant nation into an industrial monster through radical reforms carried out by competent people.

 VIN_create_the_hanoi_group_desc:0 "To make up for our scientific backwardness, Truong Chinh proposed a great idea: To create a large scientific centre in Hanoi welcoming any scientist adhering to socialist ideals. We could then pass on these technological advances to our other communist allies."

 VIN_political_reorganisation_of_the_army_desc:0 "The army is necessary to protect and spread the revolution.

 VIN_a_factory_in_every_city_desc:0 "Revolution can only be achieved by the workers. Farmers are far too dependent on landowners, and thus will have much more difficulty rejecting capitalism. Developing our industry through public works will help to increase the working population."

 VIN_invite_poum_officers_desc:0 "The POUM, the Spanish Trotskyist party, was betrayed by those who were supposed to be its allies, namely the Spanish Republican government, under the orders of the Stalinist USSR.

 VIN_the_internal_fight_continues:0 "The Internal Fight Continues"
 VIN_the_internal_fight_continues_desc:0 "It would be dangerous to think that by simply taking power from the communists, the capitalists will have disappeared from our territory. Capitalism is a method of thought rooted for centuries in the minds of oppressed peoples, and it is only by showing the way to the people that we will succeed in building a more just world."
 VIN_the_vnqdd_in_power:0 "The VNQDD In Power"

 VIN_dan_chu:0 "Dan Chu (Democracy)"
 VIN_dan_chu_desc:0 "Exploited for decades under a tyrannical colonial government acting on behalf of a country that claims to be democratic but has never allowed the voices of indigenous people to be heard, we must show our commitment to democratic principles by ensuring that they can operate smoothly and be as representative as possible."

 VIN_vietnams_tridemism_desc:0 "The VNQDDD was strongly inspired by Kuomintang and in particular its founder, Sun Yat-Sen.

 VIN_establish_the_regional_parliaments:0 "Establish The Regionals Parliaments"
 VIN_establish_the_regional_parliaments_desc:0 "A good way to help in local representation would be to create a parliament for each of Vietnam's three regions: Cochin China, Annam and Tonkin.

 VIN_anti_japanese_guerrila_tactics_desc:0 "The Japanese army may be better equipped, but we know the terrain and how to exploit it to our advantage better than anyone else. Tactics of harassing moving troops as well as discreet resupply attacks should do enough damage to allow us to better defend ourselves and then repel them."

 VIN_cooperation_with_japan:0 "Cooperation With Japan"
 VIN_cooperation_with_japan_desc:0 "Japan is a model for Cuong De. This nation, which has been able to defeat the European imperialists and create its own sphere of influence, is something that any proud Asian nation should seek to replicate. At their side, we too shall become a great empire."

 VIN_the_hoi_quy_toc_desc:0 "The "Hoi Quy Toc" will be an assembly composed of nobles and mandarins loyal to Cuong De in order to help it in its decision-making at the level of domestic or foreign policy.

 VIN_make_the_mountains_tremble_desc:0 "Artillery was most effective in fighting on flat ground, as in the North-East region. If we were to come into conflict with the owner of the Guangxi, we would be able to prevent his troops from advancing with shell rains."

 VIN_tanks_experimentation_desc:0 "The use of tanks could prove formidable in our army if it were to fight in flat terrain, where they would have less chance of breaking, unlike a large part of not only our country, but of the entire Indochinese peninsula. It would therefore be interesting to launch research projects to develop our own models."
 VIN_new_entrenchment_tactics:0 "New Entrenchment Tactics"
 VIN_new_entrenchment_tactics_desc:0 "Indochina's many fields are ideal for trench defence, something we should seek to maximize the advantage of. Adding engineering companies to our divisions would allow them to establish their fortifications in no time."

 VIN_the_flying_dragon_theory:0 "The "Flying Dragon" Theory"
 VIN_the_flying_dragon_theory_desc:0 "The "Flying Dragon" theory is based on a rather simple observation. The free flow of foreign investment, such as a dragon flying freely, provided of course that it is partially monitored by the government to avoid a new colonial situation, would be the best strategy for Vietnam. After all, we are in a resource-rich region, which would obviously attract those looking for new regions to invest in."

 VIN_the_roaring_dragon_theory_desc:0 "The "Roaring Dragon" theory is an economic theory supporting the notion that for Vietnam to achieve a level of economic development close to that of European industrialized nations, the latter must focus on perfect coordination of the agricultural and industrial sectors. This would give Vietnam economic independence, with the latter being accompanied by stability thanks to our self-sufficiency."
