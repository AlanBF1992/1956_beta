He has also made promises to improve the labour laws by doing many things such as the expansion of workers's culture services, the increase of workers salarys, and even the abolishment of night work in some industries.

The nation is divided on Jiménez either viewing him as a talanted general and a strong leader or a incompetent politican desperately attempting to hold onto outdated policies.\n\nRecently many politicians have started questioning what Jiménez'S role in the military and government should be. Keep him within the military and let potentially let him become a political threat? Or relief him of his ranks within the military and assure he is never a threat again?"
 venezuela.23.a:0 "Keep him, he's meerly just a pawn."
 venezuela.23.b:0 "He is a liability, he needs to go."
 venezuela.24.t:0 "[VEN.GetName] Seizes Trinidad"
 venezuela.24.d:0 "Venezuelan forces have launched amphibious on the island of Trinidad landings and sucessfully landing and established a beachhead, quickly overwhelming the small garrison present there and later capturing the capital, Port of Spain.\n\nIn a press confrence sometime later the Venezuelan leader, [VEN.GetLeader] stated that Trinidad and Tobago are rightful parts of Venezuela and seeks to expell all imperialists from the Caribbean. Obviously this is absurd, it's just how we respond to the matter, some people are calling for war against Venezuela where others are skeptical about wasting lives over 2 small islands."
 venezuela.24.a:0 "We will not be stepped on like this!"
 venezuela.24.b:0 "It's just 2 small islands, leave them be."
