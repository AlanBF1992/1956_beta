 india.290.desc:0 "With recent successes in electoral politics the Independent Labour Party seems in a favourable position to bring socialism to India. Support of the many other communist organizations in India is vital to maintain a stable and functioning India after the establishment of a socialist economy. In order to get some of the hardliners to cooperate we may have to offer concessions. The Internationalists of the CPI demand our entry into the Comintern after Independence, while their Opposition the National Communists demand a break from Moscow. The All India Trade Union Congress demands Union Representation in future government affairs. The Women's Liberation Association demands full and total gender equality. And the Trotskyists demand Permanent Revolution and us following their doctrine."

Their biggest political hurdle in bringing India into the future will be the All-India Muslim League wishing to establish a seperate Muslim country."
 up_victory_news:0 "It is the Unionist Party, pulling through with their broad support in religiously diverse provinces by stressing the importance of unity and fraternity in this very assorted subcontinent. Another big cluster of support came from the industrialists generally preferring the more reactionary social policies. [RAJ.GetAIMLUP]"
 ilp_victory_news:0 "It is the Independent Labour Party, which the responsibility to govern has fallen upon. Their radical vision for the future has unsettled the industrial and colonial base of the Nation. It is to be seen if they can enact their policies, but if they can it might spell the end for British rule in India sooner than anyone thought. Also uncertain is the future for the caste system widely opposed by the poorer layers of society."
