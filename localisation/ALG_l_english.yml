 algeria.1.t:0 "The First General Election"
 algeria.1.d:0 "The Provincial Government has served the nation well, but as [ALG.getnameDef] has now gained their full independence it is time for the people to be heard in electing their leader for the new nation. \n\nWho shall the people choose?"
 algeria.1.a:0 "Ferhat Abbas - A strong authoritarian"
 algeria.1.b:0 "Messali Hadj - The father of Algeria"
 algeriacivilwar.1:0 "§RThis will lead to a civil war!§!"
 algeria.2.t:0 "The Great Peasant Strike"
 algeria.2.d:0 "Since [ALG.getnameDef] has gained their independence the situation in the nation has not been entirely stable, with the lack of any effective leadership the promises that the Provincial Government has made seem nothing but broken.\n\nWith many of the peasant population feeling very unsatisifed with the Provincial Government many communist groups have organised in Algiers to stage strikes accross the city. However recently these groups have armed themselves and are clashing with the local police, the situation is very quickly growing out of control.\n\nThe only thing now is for how the situation should be handeld. Only there is great risk of the conflict turning into full blown civil war should it be handeld harshly."
 algeria.2.a:0 "Send the national guard to deal with this!"
 algeria.2.b:0 "Let the people be heard"
 algeria.3.t:0 "A Bloody Takeover"
 algeria.3.d:0 "The national guard has put a stern fight in Algiers and has managed to deal with a large majority of the armed rioters, but the rioters put a strong resistance inflicting many casulties upon the national guard.\n\nThere are now reports that the remaning groups have banded together under the PCA and are organising a rebellion in the east of the nation."
 algeria.3.a:0 "The provincial government has failed, the military needs full control over this"
 algeria.4.t:0 "Nation Wide Riots"
 algeria.4.d:0 "The rioters in Algiers have managed to organize furthur and have now almost completley taken control of the city. Therefor the national guard has been forced to retreat out of the city and the surrounding area. Along with this other organisations have risen up in many other cities across the nation under the banner of the PCA.\n\nThe national guard is now in completely unorganised but recent reports suggest that the remianing soilders are retreating to the east of the nation to fight on."
 algeria.4.a:0 "At last, the workers of Algeria are free"
